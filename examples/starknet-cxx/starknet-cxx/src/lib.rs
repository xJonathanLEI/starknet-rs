//! This is a quick demo on exposing `starknet-crypto` to C++ with the cxx bridge:
//!   https://github.com/xJonathanLEI/starknet-rs/issues/325
//!
//! This wrapper crate expose functions that operate on strings, which is bad and probably hurts
//! performance. It's possible to make the C++ side create `FieldElement` instances and operate on
//! those instead, which is much more idiomatic. That said, this demo wrapper crate seems to already
//! offer decent performance.
//!
//! Moreover, this crate does not implement error handling and always just panics on error, which
//! is likely not what you want in production.
//!
//! However, the goal of this crate is just to demonstrate using the library from C++, NOT to
//! create idiomatic bindings, which is way too much work to maintain as an example, and should be
//! a project of its own.
