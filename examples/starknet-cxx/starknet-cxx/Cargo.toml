# Using path dependency here to make development easier. However, you probably want to fetch the
# crate from GitHub instead (because the `starknet-core` crate isn't being published to crates.io
# regularly like `starknet-crypto` at the moment), which means changing the next line to:
#
# starknet-core = { git = "https://github.com/xJonathanLEI/starknet-rs" }
starknet-core = { path = "../../../starknet-core" }

# Same as above.
# 
# This entry is needed to enable the `signature-display` feature of `starknet-crypto`.
