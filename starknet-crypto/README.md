# Cryptography utilities for StarkNet

`starknet-crypto` contains utilities for performing cryptographic operations in StarkNet.

## Credits

Most of the code in this crate for the Pedersen hash implementation was inspired and modified from the awesone [`pathfinder` from Equilibrium](https://github.com/eqlabs/pathfinder/blob/b091cb889e624897dbb0cbec3c1df9a9e411eb1e/crates/pedersen/src/lib.rs).

Based on this solid foundation, ECDSA functionalities were inspired and modified from the [`crypto-cpp` implementation from StarkWare](https://github.com/starkware-libs/crypto-cpp/blob/95864fbe11d5287e345432dbe1e80dea3c35fc58/src/starkware/crypto/ecdsa.cc).
